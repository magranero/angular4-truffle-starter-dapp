### Instructions

### Part 1
1. `git clone https://github.com/magranero/traceabilityOfFairTrade.git`
2. `cd traceabilityOfFairTrade`
3. `npm install`

### Part 2
For the second part, be sure you're connected to an Ethereum client before running the commands below. If you're new, install [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) to run a local blockchain RPC server. After that, simply run `testrpc` in a new tab.

And then in the original tab, run:

4. `truffle compile` to compile your contracts
5. `truffle migrate` to deploy those contracts to the network
6. `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
